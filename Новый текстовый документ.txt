What is tortured me last time in my scooping the git?
The question - how to pull on the stage (in my working directory) content of a remote branch?
Hooray! I seemly have found it.

C:\Users\MichMakarov\Progects\Hello-word>git checkout -b What origin/Wha
Switched to a new branch 'What'
Branch What set up to track remote branch What-to-do-next from origin.

C:\Users\MichMakarov\Progects\Hello-word>git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

-------------------- let's commit and push it: -m "How to stage branch?"
but next question - how to stage an arbitrary commit?
